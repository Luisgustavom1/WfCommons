Generating Workflow Benchmarks
==============================

The WfBench is a generator of realistic workflow benchmark specifications that 
can be translated into benchmark code to be executed with current workflow 
systems. it generates workflow tasks with arbitrary performance characteristics 
(CPU, memory, and I/O usage) and with realistic task dependency structures 
based on those seen in production workflows.
